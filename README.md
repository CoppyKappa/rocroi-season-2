# About the update

Back on mid season 1 i released my rocroi mod , overall it received a good rating from the public and i promised to launch an update when season 2 released , as everyone knows season 2 released already with plenty of balance changes , quality of life features and more! , this rocroi update is focused mainly on balance , as siege recieved
an overhaul . But its also in charge on multiple quality of life features as well , and some translation fixes.

# About Balance 

In order to make rocroi **harder** i started looking at some of my waves , and ask my self if they can be beaten with less troops , with that question i re-balanced some of my initial waves and made some changes as well for some of the reinforcements .

# Wave 1 Changes 

**Initial allied pikeman number reduced from** : 180 to 160

**Initial enemy cavalry number reduced from** : 120 to 106

*This might be an slight change that should not affect drasticlly your performance in wave 1*

**Reinforcements of wave 1 have increased to justify the balance change of wave 2** : From 80 units to 100 units 

# Wave 2 changes 

**Initial enemy cavalry number increased from** : 40 to 60 

**Initial number of siege increased from** : 2 to 4

*Im still looking at this , i might increase the number of siege*

# Wave 5 changes

**reinforcements numbers of handcannoneers reduced from** : 40 to 30

# Wave 6 changes

**reinforcements numbers of handcannoneers increased from** : 40 to 50

*this change is to ensure the nesesary number of handcanonners in the last wave , although i could change this soon*

# Quality of life features 

Added autosaves! Most known as checkpoints , it doesnt matter if you loose one wave , you can always start again from there! Autosaves will be triggered after winning each wave .

The map has been improved slightly , adding more trees so the map feels more vivid . 

Allied TC has been removed , even if i liked this feature , i agree that its way too op if youre playing as the english and you can garrison troops inside , wich takes the fun out of the scenario , to fix this problem i decided to remove the allied tc , the enemy tc its still on the scenario , so the player can see clearly where the enemy has its base .

# Objective translation fixes

Objective 1 name changed from : "do not loose your enemy units" to "do not lose your enemy units"

Objective 2 name changed from : "win the second batallion" to "Win the second push of cavalry"

Obejective 4 name changed from "beat the enemy militia at the side of your basement" to "Kill the enemy militia in the southwest part of the map"

objective 6 name changed from "defend your self" to "Defend your self from the attack"

# About the future..

I might do a final update before moving on to my next project , i still need to fix the end cinematic , wich doesnt trigger at all. Ive planned making adittional and final balance changes for the last time and work on units formation .
